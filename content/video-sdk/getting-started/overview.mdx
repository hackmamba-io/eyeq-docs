# Video SDK Overview

The Perfectly Clear Video SDK (Dynamic SDK) provides real-time AI-powered video and image correction capabilities for mobile applications.

## What is the Dynamic Engine?

The Dynamic engine is an AI-based correction system optimized for:

- Real-time video processing
- Camera preview enhancement
- Batch photo correction on mobile devices

Unlike traditional correction algorithms, the Dynamic engine uses machine learning models to analyze and correct images in a single pass, making it ideal for live video applications.

## Use Cases

### Live Camera Enhancement
Enhance camera preview feeds in real-time, showing users corrected images as they capture.

### Video Processing
Apply corrections to recorded videos with consistent quality across all frames.

### Photo Apps
Batch process photos with AI-powered corrections optimized for mobile performance.

## How It Works

```
Input Frame → AI Analysis → Dynamic Correction → Output Frame
     ↓              ↓              ↓
  Camera/      Scene Detection   Exposure,
  Video File   Color Analysis    Color, etc.
```

1. **Input**: Raw frame from camera or video file
2. **Analysis**: AI models analyze scene type and color characteristics
3. **Correction**: Dynamic engine applies optimized corrections
4. **Output**: Corrected frame ready for display or encoding

## Performance

| Platform | Processing Time (1080p) | Memory Usage |
|----------|------------------------|--------------|
| iOS (iPhone 12+) | ~15ms | ~50MB |
| Android (Snapdragon 865+) | ~20ms | ~60MB |
