# Color Management

{/* TODO: Migrate from limitations section */}

## Overview

- CLI and Docker solutions are fully color managed
- Input profile is preserved as output profile by default
- Optional conversion to any output profile (e.g., sRGB)

## Important Notes

<Callout type="warn">
When loading RGB data directly via `PFCIMAGE` structure, data must be in sRGB format.
</Callout>

- Only RGB and RGBA data supported
- CMYK not supported
- Unassigned color space defaults to sRGB
