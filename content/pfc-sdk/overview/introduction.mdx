## What is Perfectly Clear?
Perfectly Clear is an AI-powered image and video correction and enhancement technology. 
It combines over twenty years of color science research with artificial intelligence to correct and enhance photos and videos at scale automatically.

The Perfectly Clear SDK is the primary offering for accessing the core Perfectly Clear engine. 
It can be seamlessly integrated into existing applications or products to enable high-quality image and video correction and enhancement.

Since its inception, EyeQ’s Perfectly Clear technology has processed hundreds of millions of images and videos each year for leading 
companies across the global imaging industry.

## Core product goals
Perfectly Clear is built around five core goals:
- **Image quality:** Automatic corrections look accurate, natural, and professional.
- **Speed:** Image processing is fast enough to meet real-time business requirements.
- **Stability:** The core engine is designed to handle large-scale workloads reliably.
- **Consistency:** Outputs are predictable, repeatable, and consistent across images.
- **Usability:** The technology is easy to integrate and simple to use across platforms.


## Key technologies
Perfectly Clear’s key technologies include:
- **Core color correction:** Enhances image accuracy by correcting color balance, removing tint, adjusting exposure, and recovering highlights for natural-looking results.
- **Retouching:** Automatic removal of dark circles, skin enhancement and smoothing, and teeth whitening.
- **Creative filters:** A collection of stylized photo and video filters that apply modern color looks, black-and-white treatments, 
and film-inspired styles to enhance images with a single tap.

## Scene and skin tone detection
Perfectly Clear uses artificial intelligence to detect image scenes and skin tones, enabling more precise and context-aware corrections.
- **AI Scene Detection:** Instantly identifies scene types and lighting conditions before applying optimized corrections.
- **AI Skin Tone Detection:** Identifies and categorizes skin tone into one of 10 distinct levels to preserve 
each individual’s unique complexion, delivering accurate and natural results across all ethnicities and lighting conditions—without applying uniform adjustments.
