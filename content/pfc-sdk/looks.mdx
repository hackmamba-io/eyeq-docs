# LOOKs

This SDK supports all LOOKs that are built into Perfectly Clear Workbench.

## Distribution

### Desktop Platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)

LOOKs are provided in a file called `v3.looks` which is included in the SDK delivery package if this feature is included in your SDK license.

### WebAssembly

Two separate libraries are provided:

| Library | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `libPfcLOOKs.a` | Contains only 'Built-in' LOOKs needed for `PFCV3PARAM` settings |
| `libPfcLooks-all.a` | Contains the full list of LOOKs below. Larger file but supports all LOOKs |

<Callout type="info">
EyeQ can custom build a LOOKs library with only the LOOKs you will enable and expose to your customers. This provides the smallest possible filesize while still providing all correction capability you choose to offer. Contact your EyeQ technical contact for this free service.
